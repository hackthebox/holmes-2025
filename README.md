| Category | Name | Description | Difficulty [⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐] |
|-|-|-|-|
|Threat Intelligence | [1: The Card](</The Card/>) | Holmes receives a breadcrumb from Dr. Nicole Vale - fragments from a string of cyber incidents across Cogwork-1. Each lead ends the same way: a digital calling card signed JM. | ⭐⭐ |
| SOC | [2: The Watchman's Residue](</The Watchmans Residue/>) | With help from D.I. Lestrade, Holmes acquires logs from a compromised MSP connected to the city’s financial core. The MSP’s AI servicedesk bot looks to have been manipulated into leaking remote access keys - an old trick of Moriarty’s. | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| DFIR | [3: The Enduring Echo](</The Enduring Echo/>) | LeStrade passes a disk image artifacts to Watson. It's one of the identified breach points, now showing abnormal CPU activity and anomalies in process logs. | ⭐⭐ |
| DFIR | [4: The Tunnel Without Walls](</The Tunnel Without Walls/>) | A memory dump from a connected Linux machine reveals covert network connections, fake services, and unusual redirects. Holmes investigates further to uncover how the attacker is manipulating the entire network! | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Malware Analysis | [5: The Payload](</The Payload/>) | With the malware extracted, Holmes inspects its logic. The strain spreads silently across the entire network. Its goal? Not destruction-but something more persistent…friends. | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
